        A remarkable about page is genuine, approachable, and distinguished. It should give the 
        visitor a glimpse into what working with you might be like. You can include personal 
        interests, stories, and photos that convey the unique story of your business. You may 
        also include information about who’s on your team and what their roles are.About pages are 
        personal to you and your company, so the structure of your about page will vary based on 
        what you want to highlight. However, you’ll start with the same writing process.

        Every business has a story to tell. Even if you’re running a startup with a brief history, 
        you’ll want to share your company’s progress. Talk about how you got to where you are today 
        on your about page.
